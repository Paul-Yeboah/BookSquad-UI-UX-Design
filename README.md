# BookSquad-UI-UX-Design
BookSquad is a new book shop that aims to serve university students and corporate women between the ages of 25-55 years.
The challenge however is that they need a platform to market and distribute their books. 
After consulting different stakeholders, the consensus was that the app should be user-friendly, easy to access and secure.
The solution therefore is to design a mobile application to enable BookSquad manage their customer database and easily update the digital library. 
The mobile app would enable their customers to buy books as well as make secure payments.
